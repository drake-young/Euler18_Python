# Euler18_Python

Problem 18 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. The Tree structure required by the problem was modeled as a 2D list with 0s padding the areas of unused numbers. This can be seen in the file Problem18_Triangle.txt. Since this problem is small enough to brute-force, that method was used to highlight python's recursion capabilities.

## Project Euler Problem 18 -- Maximum Path Sum I

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

**3**<br/>
**7** 4<br/>
2 **4** 6<br/>
8 5 **9** 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

75<br/>
95 64<br/>
17 47 82<br/>
18 35 87 10<br/>
20 04 82 47 65<br/>
19 01 23 75 03 34<br/>
88 02 77 73 07 63 67<br/>
99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92<br/>
41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33<br/>
41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29<br/>
53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14<br/>
70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57<br/>
91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48<br/>
63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31<br/>
04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23

**NOTE:** As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)
